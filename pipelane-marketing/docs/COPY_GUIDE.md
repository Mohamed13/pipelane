# Copy Guide

Pipelane marketing content targets first-time operators. Keep copy short, clear, and focused on value.

## Principles
- Plain language first: verbs in active voice, everyday words, one idea per sentence (20 words max).
- Value above the fold: headline + support line explain who we help and the benefit within the first screen.
- Microcopy must be scannable: short H2/H3, lists of three to five bullets, bold or badges for the key term.
- Tell the reader what to do next: every section ends with a clear CTA or pointer to the next step.
- Always provide context for numbers: explain the metric, the baseline, and what it means for the operator.

## Testing And Iteration
- A/B test major headlines and CTA labels when traffic allows; keep a control for at least one full sending cycle.
- Re-read new copy aloud; if it sounds complex, rewrite before shipping.
- Validate forms and micro-interactions with two user shadow sessions before pushing to production.
